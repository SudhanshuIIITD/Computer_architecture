# Computer_architecture
This projects contains a detailed implementation of a
32-bit processor based on a subset of instructions from RISC-V
ISA. The Micro-architecture contains 5 pipeline stages namely
Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory and Write back. Additionally,
it also has a MAC execution unit to handle MAC instructions
which are not part of RISC-V ISA.
